Data input
==========

|project_name| doesn't read data itself. What seems to be a lack of functionality
on the first glance is in fact a huge benefit.

You can use your own methods and models for data retrieval which might include
authorisation, authentification, caching and much more. 
You are not limited to the features a delivered by a report tool.

 
Using your own methods for data retrieval allows you to access data from any
source (any database, any file types like csc, xml, json, excel sheets, etc.) 
and also to use data from differents sources within the same job.

Data rows can be arrays or objects. 

|project_name| accepts data in three different ways.

    * Passing all data within an array or any iterable to the run() method.
        |project_name| iterates over the data set and calls the next() method 
        for each entry.
        
     * Passing chunks of data within an array or any iterable by calling the run()
        method for each chunk.
        |project_name| iterates over the data set and calls the next() method 
        for each entry. 
   
    * Passing single rows by calling the next() method for each data row. This
        is in many cases the most efficent way as you don't have to collect your
        data into an array.

Multi-Dimensional Data
----------------------

Handling of multi-dimensional data makes |project_name| extreme powerful.
It let's you iterate over nested arrays with the same functionaity as for the
primary data set. So you can define groups and calculate values for any data
dimension.

Data dimension can exist in form of nested arrays, object methods delivering
related data or even completely independent.

Instead of joining data during data retrieval you can get related data at the
moment you need them. This can save a lot of memory consumpiton.
 









To pass chunks or the whole dataset to phpReport call the run mehod. For chunks you must set the second paramet (finalize) to false.
Call run for the last chunck with finalize = true or call the end mehthod afterwords.

.. php:method:: data($source, $noData, $rowDetail, $noGroupChange, $parameters) : Report

    Called when group values between two rows are not equal. Each group has
    its own groupHeader. 

    Group headers are called from the changed group level down to the lowest
    declared group (within an data dimension).

    :param mixed $source: The source for the next data dimension.
    :param mixed $noData: The action to be executed when the source doesn't return any data.
    :param mixed $rowDetail: The action to be executed for each row returned be $source.
    :param mixed $noGroupChange: The action to be executed when two consecutive rows don't trigger
     a group change.
    :param array|null $parameters: Any parameter to be passed to $source.
