# Collector
Cumulating values is very powerful feature of phpReport.

For each value to be cumulated an object will be instantiated. These objects will be hold as an item in a collector class.

By default phpReport instatiates three collectors.
1) A row counter collector

2) A group counter collector

3) A collector for declared values to be cumulated.

<ul>
  <li>A1</li>
  <li>A1</li>
  <li>A1</li>
</ul>
