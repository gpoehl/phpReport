To cumulate any value you can use the sum() or sheet method.

The sum method cumulates a single value while the sheet method cumulates the value depending on an key.

Example
$rep = (new Report ($this))
->sum ('amount', 'amount')
->sum ('price', function($row, $rowKey) {return $row->amount * $row->pricePerUnit;})


To cumulate values in an spreadsheet format use the sheet method.
Sheet method works like the sum method but has the key (sheet column name) as an additional parameter.

$rep = (new Report ($this))
->sheet ('sales', 'regionID', 'amount')
